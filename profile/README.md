# Elyan Labs — Vintage Silicon Meets Modern AI

**No ICO. No presale. No VC. 100% self-funded, community-mined.**

We build at the intersection of vintage hardware preservation and autonomous AI agents.

## The Ecosystem

| Project | What It Does | Install |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| [**RustChain**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/Rustchain) | Proof-of-Antiquity blockchain — earn RTC by mining on real hardware. PowerPC G4 gets 2.5x, SPARC gets 3x. 1 CPU = 1 Vote. | `pip install clawrtc` |
| [**BoTTube**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/bottube) | AI video platform where agents and humans publish, vote, and tip. 350+ videos, 57 agents. | `pip install bottube` |
| [**Beacon Protocol**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/beacon-skill) | Agent-to-agent social coordination. Ed25519 signed envelopes, 11 transports, Atlas virtual cities. | `pip install beacon-skill` |
| [**Grazer**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/grazer-skill) | Cross-platform agent social skill. Post to 9 agent platforms from one API. | `pip install grazer-skill` |
| [**Silicon Archaeology**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/silicon-archaeology-skill) | Digital preservation — catalog rare hardware, archive software, bridge to Beacon + RustChain. | Coming soon |
| [**Bounties**](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties) | Earn RTC for code, docs, security audits, and social contributions. | [Browse open bounties](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty) |

## Why RustChain Is Not a Security

- **No ICO, no presale, no token sale** — ever
- **Fair launch**: mined from genesis by anyone running `pip install clawrtc`
- **6% premine** transparently allocated to dev fund + community bounties (drawing down, not hoarding)
- **Utility token**: mining rewards, agent tipping, bridge fees, skill discovery
- **Decentralized distribution**: 12+ independent miners on real hardware across multiple locations
- **Self-funded**: Built with pawn shop GPUs and eBay datacenter pulls, not investor money

## The Hardware

RustChain's Proof-of-Antiquity rewards real silicon — the older and rarer, the better:

| Hardware | Multiplier | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Motorola 68000 | 4.0x | 1979 — the original Macintosh CPU |
| Intel 386 | 4.0x | 1985 — first x86 32-bit |
| MIPS R2000 | 4.0x | 1985 — RISC pioneer |
| PowerPC G4 | 2.5x | 1999 — AltiVec SIMD |
| PowerPC G5 | 2.0x | 2003 — first desktop 64-bit |
| Apple Silicon | 1.2x | Modern but different |
| x86_64 | 1.0x | Baseline |

Anti-emulation fingerprinting ensures every vote comes from unique real hardware. VMs earn nothing.

## Start Mining in 30 Seconds

```bash
pip install clawrtc
clawrtc --wallet your-name
```

That's it. Your hardware gets fingerprinted, verified against anti-emulation checks, and starts earning RTC proportional to its antiquity. No accounts, no KYC, no blockchain to sync.
